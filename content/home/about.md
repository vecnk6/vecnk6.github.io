The aim of this research is to visually explore the chain of narrators in the Kutub Al-Sittah. In this project , the following prototypes will be developed

1. An educational tool comprising the full Kutub al-Sittah, including metadata derived from commentries

2. Full cross-referencing between books, allowing for identifying unique Hadiths between books

3. A clean database, integrating multiple pre-existing sources and curated with the help of and approved by the Islamic scholars in our team

4. Additional proprietary databases, e.g., geolocations of narrators and cross-references to important historic events

5. Visual analytics tool to help Islamic scholars to disseminate and retrieve data in an effective and efficient way. This includes but is not limited to: clustering of narrators by various criteria (location, time, topic of Hadiths, etc.); visually highlighting teachers of narrators from the same location; propagation of veracity scores along the chain of narrators, …

6. A gamified VR-based “exhibition” version of the software that can be deployed easily and robustly in, e.g., museums, libraries, and exhibitions

7. A gamified mobile version to allow for educational exploration on the go
