Holds a master's degree in Computer Based Information System and 12 years' experience in engineering and managing projects related to Information Technology and Software Development. His experience in working on R&D projects, academic projects and transforming them into practical pioneering projects is one of the most important things I can offer to the project. He converted his master's thesis project into a mobile application at the Saudi Telecom Company and worked at KAUST University to transform a research and development project to a technology-based start-up company. He also converted one of his patents into a successful product available in the market.
